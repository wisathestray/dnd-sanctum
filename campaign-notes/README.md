## Campaign notes
### Feb 22 hooks

Captain Xendros
Party goes to her to buy magic items.  She is unable to procure any specific magic items because her primary contact for acquiring magic items has not been in contact with her for several weeks.  She knows that one of his stops is an Abbey on a nearby island.  It has been very creatively named 'Abbey Island'.  She has never personally been there herself, but surely the local Mariner's guild could assist with the exact location.  The name of her contact is Davion.

Mariner's Guild - Eden Gill
They can tell the characters exactly where the island is.  They can also tell them that the island is hazardous to approach and the best person suited to get them safely on the island would be Major Borsun.  They are able to give directions to the island that he occupies, and it's fairly easy to find owing to the lighthouse.

The Island
The clerics who inhabit the Isle are in service to Besmara - or so they believe.  In reality, they have been worshiping Syrul, a goddess of deceit.  Recently, they have become very interested in the acquisition of a powerful artifact known as the Wand of Orcus.
Captain Xendros' contact (Davion) is still on the island, as he had been there when the pirates attacked.  He was injured in the attack, but his wounds are not life-threatening.  He was on the island as part of a somewhat routine stop - meeting with the clerics and fencing magic items that he had come across in his travels.
