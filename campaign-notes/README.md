## Campaign notes
### Jan 27 hooks

Captain Xendros
Party goes to her to buy magic items.  She is unable to procure any specific magic items because her primary contact for acquiring magic items has not been in contact with her for several weeks.  She knows that one of his stops is an Abbey on a nearby island.  It has been very creatively named 'Abbey Island'.  She has never personally been there herself, but surely the local Mariner's guild could assist with the exact location.

Mariner's Guild - Eden Gill
They can tell the characters exactly where the island is.  They can also tell them that the island is hazardous to approach and the best person suited to get them safely on the island would be Major Borsun.  They are able to give directions to the island that he occupies, and it's fairly easy to find owing to the lighthouse.

The Island
The clerics who inhabit the Isle were formerly in service to Pocran, however a combination of their remote location, direct intervention by their deity, and some internal dark influence has taken them down a darker path.  Recently, they have become very interested in the acquisition of a powerful artifact known as the Wand of Orcus.
Agents of the Scarlet Brotherhood got wind of the desires of the Abbey and began rumors that the Isle housed a large trove of treasure.  Several pirates followed the rumors but were not prepared for the undead in the Skull Dunes.
Captain Xendros' contact is still on the island, as he had been there when the pirates attacked.  He was injured in the attack, but his wounds are not life-threatening.  What he can tell the players is that he had been contacted by the Isle to see if he could get more information on the possible whereabouts of the Wand of Orcus.  He had never gotten any solid leads.  During the fight, he had heard several of the pirates make mention of a "treasure", but he has no awareness of there being anything on the island.
