Cretin: Don't forget Esoteric Vengeance, (but it DOES cost a spell slot, however there's no attack roll for it) Cast Slow (C) on the PCs in a 40 foot cube (up to 6 creatures). If they all pass, cast it again. Get a Guardian of Faith cast. Cast Spiritual Weapon. Cast Spirit Guardians next turn IF not concentrating on anything, and use Spiritual Weapon on your bonus action.

Fowler: Don't forget your Parry reaction to try to avoid being hit by melee! Get Leadership going ASAP on as many monsters as possible. Then just start whacking at stuff. Go after Kelmad, since he'll look like a worthy opponent.

Avalia: Cast Fear (C) on Donnie, unless you can catch 2+ PC's in a 10' radius sphere for Confusion (C)) Neither of these is a Charm. Next, try to get Kilvin grappled with Tentacles. If grappled, Extract Brain next turn. Pray this doesn't actually kill him.

Ivy:  Ray of Enfeeblement (C) against Kelmad.  Claw the nearest enemy.  Magic missile at range.

Penley:  Get within 20 feet of as many PCs as possible, and case Waking Dreams.  (DC 16 CHA save)  Lasts 6 rounds.  Then Command Donnie to drop his weapon, if he's not incapacitated.
