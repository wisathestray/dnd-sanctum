## Crab Combat


While sailing toward X, Donnie notices a dark form in the water.  It doesn’t have a recognizable shape, and it even seems to perhaps lengthen and then compress as you observe it.</br>
 
Eventually, several smaller dark forms also appear, almost as though they’ve broken off from the main entity.  Their shape becomes sharper as they move toward the surface of the water, and _1d10_ pairs of eyestalks emerge from the water.</br>
 
As you watch, a few small crabs surface and regard your ship with their eyestalks.  Another small sea creature, perhaps a lobster?, also surfaces.  The group of crustaceans begin swimming toward the ship, and if you make no move to stop them, they will begin to attempt to scuttle up the sides of the hull.</br>

As they move onto the deck, you get a better look at the crabs and their lobster companion.  The crabs vary in size, from tankard-sized to plate-sized in diameter.  The crabs are muted colors, in lighter shades of earth tones that match beach sand.  Several of the crabs are holding shiny pieces of shell and one even appears to be holding a barnacle-encrusted button.</br>

The lobster bears no resemblance to its crab companions.  It is predominantly iridescent blue, but when the sunlight shines just right the shell takes on a more green cast.  It is a bit large for a lobster, although not the largest you've ever seen, about 2 feet in length and perhaps a foot high.  It waves its long antenna about, appearing to assess each of you.</br>


Everyone roll Animal Handling.  High roll is going to get images from the Lobster.</br>

_X, you look down at this lobster and inexplicably know that its name is Shern.  The name just enters your conscience.  As you regard this creature, you think about the two giant crabs that you fought back in Saltmarsh, and you feel elation at the memory of their defeat.  You feel excited at the prospect of fighting again, to face an even stronger foe.  Looking down at this brilliantly colored lobster, you realize that he's waiting for you to indicate that you accept a challenge._</br>


If accept, Shern waves his antenna excitedly and the largest of the crabs scuttles over to the side of the deck.  It waves its claws in the air, dancing back and forth.  Momentarily, the dark shape that had been following the boat gets darker as it rises in the water, and hundreds of crabs break the surface.  They swim en masse toward the ship, then scrape and scuttle their way up the sides of the hull and any available rigging.  Much like at Crabber's Cove, they form a circle around the periphery of the deck, leaving the space in the middle clear.  Several of the crabs wave around starfish, and as you watch they snip off individual starfish arms and trade those with other crabs for pieces of shell and coins.  It appears that the vocation of snack vending at combat events is not limited to only terrestrial sports.</br>
