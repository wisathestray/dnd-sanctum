## From Armin's point of view, the priest who is now technically in charge of the Abbey
</br>
The passing of Master Gauvain is a great loss for our Order.  I carry the mantle of leadership, but I do not do so without great reservation.  Gauvain alone knew of how to keep the skeletons of the Skull Dunes at bay, and that knowledge seems to have passed on with him.  It was Besmara's fortune that allowed me to recover his medallion, to remind the others of their stations.</br>
It is a pity that Davion is still with us.  His open worship of Iuz in this house of Besmara is blasphemy, and I cannot abide it much longer.  He is a burden upon us - costing us precious food and water and offering nothing in return.  In time I may have Drugo remove him forcefully - or perhaps he could become an offering to Besmara, to prove we have not turned against her.  Might the invasion have been punishment for harboring a non-believer?

## From Davion's point of view, the cult fanatic who was visiting the Abbey.  
<i>He is the contact of Captain Xendros.</i>

It is simply unthinkable that Armin the Weak would be in charge of this sorry rabble of survivors.  Drugo is the only obvious choice to lead, and still Armin puts his fate in the hands of Tarathiel.  It speaks volumes that their order would have need to hire a mercenary to train them to defend themselves.  When I get back to the mainland, word of the weakness of this island will be delivered quickly to the Oppressors.  The mere existence of such weakness is blasphemy.</br>
Once the Temple of Iuz is able to overtake the island, we will be able to search for the treasure vaults that I am so certain lie below.  Armin claims to know nothing of their existence.  He may be telling the truth - after all, were I Guavain, I may not have trusted him with such important information either.  It was always Guavain himself who rode down to meet us at the edge of the Dunes.  Armin is too weak to hold back the undead who guard this place.

## From the point of view of Tarathiel
</br>
If ever there was a sorry lot of survivors, it is this one.  Armin, leader only in name, does nothing to inspire loyalty or respect.  Were it not for the hierarchy of his church, I fear he may already be dead.</br>
Davion, also uninspiring, has done nothing to endear himself to the rest of the group.  His grumbling is near-constant, and the bickering between he and Armin does nothing for morale.</br>
Drugo - I do not trust that man with anything.  Firstly, because he is simply too stupid to correctly follow even the simplest instruction.  And secondly, because I know he views me as a competitor.  It is no wonder the Abbey brought in mercenary consultation.  If left to his own devices, surely Drugo would have declared wars upon the sea by now.</b>
