# Deities

## Besmara
Besmara is a recent god, or a resurgent god - details are not certain. She appears to be of Suel heritage but recently sailed her way into the Common pantheon when piracy became big business. She is an ascended mortal sponsored by Procan.
</br></br>
Besmara (bes-MAR-uh) is the goddess of pirates and sea monsters. She is brash, lusty, confrontational, and greedy, but follows a code of honor and is loyal to her crew and allies as long as it serves her interests. She cares little for senseless murder or other unprofitable acts, but is willing to take risks to attain great prizes. Even the most irreligious pirate captain throws a share of treasure overboard now and then as tribute for the Pirate Queen. Mayors of port cities and captains of merchant vessels curse her name, for her followers are a direct threat to legitimate trade. She has little power or interest in the mortal world beyond the sea and its immediate reach.
</br></br>
<i>Carve your name on the ever-changing sea with a saber of terror and triumph. Fight for plunder, fame, and glory, and earn your place among the legends of the sea.</i>
</br></br>
She has few priests, for pirates are more superstitious than religious, but she counts among her followers anyone who has made a desperate prayer to her when facing death on the sea or given tribute to gain her favor.

## Syrul
</br>
Syrul is a Suel goddess of deceit and trickery and patron of the Scarlet Brotherhood, rarely worshiped openly outside their lands. She likes to hide the truth under layers of illusion.
</br></br>
Syrul (SIGH-rul) appears as a dirty, smelly old hag in tattered clothing (an illusion that covers her nondescript appearance). She is never without Small Lie (a dagger of venom made from an evil unicorn's horn) and Harsh Truth (a rod of withering made from a gold dragon's crystallized soul), and rides a great nightmare called Flamedevil. She can see through any deception or illusion, and her holy symbol is a forked tongue. Syrul avoids other deities except for Pyremius, whom she partners with in many things.
</br></br>
<i>The best way to protect what you know is to shield it in a lie. Speech is deadlier than any weapon; the greatest and smallest fall with a well-spoken untruth. Give your word to advance your cause, and break it when it is no longer of use. Trust is for fools, and betraying a fool is the greatest gift and lesson you can give them. Honesty and straightforwardness are for the dull-witted.</i>
</br></br>
Her churches get along well despite their communication obstacles. Her clerics use their ability to lie effectively in situations where they can cause the most trouble: markets, courtrooms, embassies, and fortunetellers' booths. Many are skilled actors, performing in self-written plays that slander authority figures. They engage in debate, and are hired by leaders to confuse and misdirect spies and unwarranted foreign dignitaries. They travel to escape persecution, to find rumors to escalate, and to exploit the trust of greedy and foolish explorers.

## From Armin's point of view, the priest who is now technically in charge of the Abbey
</br>
The passing of Master Gauvain is a great loss for our Order.  I carry the mantle of leadership, but I do not do so without great reservation.  Gauvain alone knew of how to keep the skeletons of the Skull Dunes at bay, and that knowledge seems to have passed on with him.  It was Besmara's fortune that allowed me to recover his medallion, to remind the others of their stations.</br>
It is a pity that Davion is still with us.  His open worship of Iuz in this house of Besmara is blasphemy, and I cannot abide it much longer.  He is a burden upon us - costing us precious food and water and offering nothing in return.  In time I may have Drugo remove him forcefully - or perhaps he could become an offering to Besmara, to prove we have not turned against her.  Might the invasion have been punishment for harboring a non-believer?
</br>

## From Davion's point of view, the cult fanatic who was visiting the Abbey.  
<i>He is the contact of Captain Xendros.</i>
</br>
It is simply unthinkable that Armin the Weak would be in charge of this sorry rabble of survivors.  Drugo is the only obvious choice to lead, and still Armin puts his fate in the hands of Tarathiel.  It speaks volumes that their order would have need to hire a mercenary to train them to defend themselves.  When I get back to the mainland, word of the weakness of this island will be delivered quickly to the Oppressors.  The mere existence of such weakness is blasphemy.</br>
Once the Temple of Iuz is able to overtake the island, we will be able to search for the treasure vaults that I am so certain lie below.  Armin claims to know nothing of their existence.  He may be telling the truth - after all, were I Guavain, I may not have trusted him with such important information either.  It was always Guavain himself who rode down to meet us at the edge of the Dunes.  Armin is too weak to hold back the undead who guard this place.
</br>

## From the point of view of Tarathiel
</br>
If ever there was a sorry lot of survivors, it is this one.  Armin, leader only in name, does nothing to inspire loyalty or respect.  Were it not for the hierarchy of his church, I fear he may already be dead.</br>
Davion, also uninspiring, has done nothing to endear himself to the rest of the group.  His grumbling is near-constant, and the bickering between he and Armin does nothing for morale.</br>
Drugo - I do not trust that man with anything.  Firstly, because he is simply too stupid to correctly follow even the simplest instruction.  And secondly, because I know he views me as a competitor.  It is no wonder the Abbey brought in mercenary consultation.  If left to his own devices, surely Drugo would have declared wars upon the sea by now.</b>
