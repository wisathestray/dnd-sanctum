Each night, I roll a d20 to see if the players are attacked during the night (rolls don't start until Day 3, and the DC goes up by 1 per day.)</br>


Encounters:
A turkey jumps out of a nearby bush and starts eating the berries.  (DIS on next gathering check if it's not killed)</br>
You hear hounds in the distance (2 hounds or more will attack the next day)
Fireflies flit around your fire.  They seem to like it here.</br>
The nightmare tentacles attempt to attack your fire durin the night.  Roll a d20 to see if you are able to get a full rest (DC: 15)</br>
Rain.  Everything is wet.  (the next person to go out hunting or gathering will be attacked by frogs)</br>
Several birds land near the camp.  1d4 seeds dropped.</br>
You hear the sounds of spiders out in the darkness.  The next morning, a spider nest has spawned near the camp.</br>
