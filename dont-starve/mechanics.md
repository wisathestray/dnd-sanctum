I roll on the Day Encounters table to see how the day goes.

Set traps (Hunting roll)</br>
Fishing (Hunting roll)</br>
Hunt monsters (Hunting roll)</br>

Gather for healing (Gathering roll)</br>
Explore the map (No roll, but lets them give someone else ADV on their check)</br>

As long as an effort is made, they retain their sanity.  If they don't put any effort into it, or elect not to do it, the next day they roll checks at disadvantage.


Each night, I roll on the Random Night Encounters table to see if they are attacked during the night.  The first 3 days, monster attacks cannot happen.
