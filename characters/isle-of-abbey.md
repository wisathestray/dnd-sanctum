## ARMIN (Ozymandias)
</br>
Armin (NE male human priest) barely survived the battle against the pirates because he tried to rescue important books and scrolls from the burning abbey, and a collapsing hall closed a doorway behind him. He was forced to abandon the written works, and he escaped only after a wall collapsed and provided him with an escape route.
</br>
Armin is now the highest-ranking cleric and the leader of the survivors. He is a capable administrator, but he does not inspire loyalty or trust in those under him. Underlings obey him because of the hierarchical structure of the abbey's chain of command, not because he shows any strong leadership. If attacked, he defends himself to the best of his abilities. 
</br>
If the characters attempt to negotiate, Armin is treacherous and unlikely to keep any agreement (except at sword point). He wants to get word of the abbey's destruction to the mainland, and he hopes to hold the island until help arrives.
</br>
Armin wears a special golden medallion (see the sidebar) that allows safe passage through the undead guardians of the Winding Way (the tunnels below the abbey ruin). As the highest-ranking cleric on the island, Armin wears the medallion as a symbol of his faith, but he doesn't know about its special property or about the dangers of the Winding Way.
</br>

### GOLDEN MEDALLION

This medallion is a golden disk inscribed with complex geometric designs, worth 30 gp. It is not magical, but undead of the Winding Way recognize it and allow anyone who possesses the medallion, plus their companions, to pass safely unless the undead are attacked. Only the undead guardians recognize the medallion, and it cannot be used for safe passage past traps or other guardians in the Winding Way, or for protection from any other undead on or off the island. The undead do not obey orders from a character who wears the medallion.
</br>

## DAVION (Odium) - Captain Xendros' contact
Davion (NE male human cult fanatic) was visiting the abbey on business when the pirates attacked. He gave a brave account of himself during the battle, though he survived by sheer chance. He ran through the burning building to save his spell scrolls and other valuables. As the flames mounted, Davion was forced to retreat to the cellars with his rescued goods.
</br>
He is a grumbler and annoys everyone with his constant griping. Davion and Armin dislike each other intensely. If one gets into trouble, the other will do nothing to help.
</br>
Davion desperately wants to leave the island and get on with his life. If the characters do not attack Davion immediately, they might be able to strike a deal with him. He will draw a rough map of the abbey ruins in return for 200 gp and safe passage off the island. (If this occurs, you should provide only a rough map of the cellars without including the Winding Way.) Davion refuses to join the party in a fight against the other survivors.
</br>

## TARATHIEL (Bayleaf)
</br>
Tarathiel (LE male elf bard) is a mercenary who works for the highest bidder. He was hired by the abbey as a training instructor for the guards. If the party does not attack him immediately, negotiation is possible. Tarathiel can be bought off for 500 gp and safe passage off the island. He does not draw a map for the party or help them attack his former employers, but he does tell them there are treasure-filled tunnels beneath the abbey. If pressed, Tarathiel admits that the treasure is guarded (true) and claims it is worth 10,000 gp (false).
</br>
Tarathiel is an excellent swordsman and an above-average tactician in small skirmishes. Armin placed him in charge of defending the cellars. If Tarathiel is captured, killed, or bribed, defense of the cellars becomes a hectic, haphazard affair.
</br>

## DRUGO (Ogmund)
Drugo (CE male human gladiator) is a huge, stupid, mean-spirited fighter. In battle he is awesome, wielding his spear untiringly. During the battle with the pirates, a blow from a warhammer knocked him unconscious.
</br>
He was left for dead and later dragged to safety by clerics retreating to the cellars. He is embarrassed that he did not die in the battle and will not make that mistake twice.
</br>
There is no negotiating with Drugo. His demands are simple: surrender or fight. As a tactician, Drugo is wholly wanting. He is likely to overlook the simplest of ambush opportunities, and his only offensive tactic is a headlong frontal attack. Drugo believes he should oversee the defense of the island and resents Tarathiel's presence. He gladly leaves the elf in the lurch if the chance to do so arises.
</br>

## DISCIPLES
</br>
The remnants of the abbey's faithful (two acolytes and two cultists) are not a particularly spirited lot. After the devastating loss to the pirates, they are not eager to join battle with anyone. These low-level clerks and helpers survived the battle and the burning of the abbey by hiding in the cellars. Although the heat, smoke, and lack of fresh air might have killed the disciples in a well-sealed room, the cellars of the abbey are riddled with small rat passages and ventilation shafts that pulled air in from the outside, keeping the heat and smoke radiating upward and permitting the disciples and their guards to survive the flames.
The disciples perform only the functions needed for the survival of the group. They fight only if necessary and surrender at the first opportunity if any fight turns against them. If questioned, they know very little about the island and the abbey. 
</br>

## GUARDS
</br>
These three disciplined warriors (veterans) are the last of the abbey guards. All were dying of their wounds when they were found and healed by the clerics. Armin has ordered them to obey Tarathiel, but the guards prefer Drugo as their leader because he is one of them and not a hired sword. They will fight to the death to save the clerics.
</br>

### THE SURVIVORS' RESPONSE
</br>
The survivors in the abbey provide many potential social interactions and combat encounters. Use the following guidelines to decide how the survivors react to the characters' actions.
</br>

### HOSTILE
</br>
If the characters enter the abbey with swords drawn and spells blazing, the survivors believe the pirates have returned and mount a solid defense.
</br>
Once combat begins, the survivors fight to the death except for Tarathiel. He fights hard. but as the lone nonbeliever he is not ready to die for his employer.
</br>
Drugo, the acolyte, and the cultist call for help and attempt to delay the PCs. The rest of the cultists rush to attack. They all rush forward, open the door to their chambers, and join in the fray.</br>
The cultists try to attack the characters from multiple directions. The acolytes and cultists throw themselves into the fight without regard for their safety. All of the cultists target clerics, wizards, and other casters in the group first, since they know well that a spell or two can offset their numerical advantage.</br>
Armin and Davion try to remain in their rooms while casting spells through the doorway. Davion uses hold person to shut down potent warriors, while Armin relies on spirit guardians and spiritual weapon to wear down the characters.</br>
The veterans try to keep Armin safe. possibly by standing in the doorway to his chamber. Davion shrinks back in his room, trying to stay clear of the fight. The rest of the cultists don't particularly like him, and none rush to defend him. If a character moves into his room, however, the cultists might try to corner that character.
</br>
Tarathiel cares only about survival. He uses his short-bow to fire from his room, and employs his magic and abilities to hinder the characters. He keeps one 2nd-level slot in reserve for invisibility to disappear from view as the fight winds down. Once invisible, he sneaks away if the characters seem treacherous, or offers to negotiate if they seem honorable and willing to uphold any bargains they make with him.
</br>

### CONVERSATIONAL
</br>
Parleying with the survivors is difficult, because Drugo is one of the first occupants the characters meet.
</br>
He is spoiling for a fight. but might be willing to talk as a delaying tactic while the other survivors mobilize. Drugo keeps the characters talking until the rest of the survivors enter the room. He then attacks. unless Armin orders him to stand down.
</br>
Armin is the first named NPC to arrive, followed by the veterans from areas 5, 7, and 8, and the acolyte from area 6. If the characters appear to offer a way of getting off the island, Armin orders Drugo to keep his hands off his weapons. Davion, Tarathiel, and the cultist from area 10 arrive next. Davion begs the characters to take him with them, 
even offering to join them in battle against the characters. Tarathiel keeps an eye on the situation. If the party appears powerful and confident, he turns invisible as soon as he can and slips away to escape.
</br>
Armin drives the negotiation. He settles for nothing less than passage to the mainland for him and two of the veterans so that he can get help to fortify the island and rebuild. He offers the characters a place of honor in the cult. The characters might try to trick the survivors into splitting their numbers. Armin refuses to abandon the island, because doing so is deserving of a death sentence in the eyes of bis superiors. The rest of the residents can be persuaded to leave peacefully, however, especially if the characters create a ruse to make it appear that Armin or the cult leaders have given permission for them to do so.</br>
If a fight does break out after negotiation, most of the survivors are not eager to die. If Armin and Drugo are defeated, the veterans will surrender if Tarathiel is alive and capable of counseling them to do so. He also throws down his weapons or attempts to flee.
