## Fane Church (Koster)

In life, Fane Koster was a young noble who was born into wealth.  The Koster family was known for their finely tailored clothing, specifically woven to adapt to the wearer.  Fane's father had perfected a technique of weaving transmutation and illusion magics directly into the cloth of garments.  This served to provide exceptional fit and fashion into their products.</br>
Fane was well on his way to taking over the family business when he met an older gentleman who commissioned a suit and cloak.  He found himself flattered by the attention paid to him by the older man (Damon Karthane), and was drawn to his obvious eye for fine clothing.  They spoke at length about clothing, art, and culture - finding they had many shared love and passions.  Upon finding out the true nature of the man known as Damon, Fane found himself even more intrigued.  Another year went by, during which Fane relentlessly dug into the idea of vampires and vampirism.</br>
After many long discussions, and a great deal of reservation on the part of Damon, he finally agreed to turn his younger protoge.  Predictably, Fane's family did not react well to his undeath and he was disowned.  His father, a nobleman of Suloise heritage, called upon the local leaders to destroy both Fane and Damon as a taint upon their lineage.  Fane and Damon fled the region, moving Northwest to X and far from the Koster family name.</br>
Now Fane Church, the new vampire set up a business and began producing garments once again.  Without his father's assistance in procuring cloth, Fane needed to form new business relationships and quickly learned just how difficult that could be as a vampire.  The suppliers most willing to work with a suspected vampire turned out to be some of the least upstanding, and Fane soon found himself working primarily with smugglers.</br>

## Later Life

50 years prior: Damon disappeared

30 years prior: Fane met Emilien.  He saw a kindred spirit in his passion for art.  Fane sought out a ship for moving art pieces for Emilien.  Had a shipment intercepted by pirates.  Fane approached a sellsword for more information about the stolen shipment and hired him to recover it.</br>
Found out that a small coalition of pirates was responsible for the heist.  To avoid future trouble, Fane negotiated a deal with the Admiral to provide his ship amnesty (for a fee).  A year or two later, the Admiral was killed in a short-side argument over a woman.  His successor, a hot-tempered Gnome with the fantasy version of a Napoleon complex, tried extorting Fane for tenfold the amount he had previously been paying.  After a few months of attempted diplomancy with the man, he severely overstepped Fane's patience by threatening Emilien.</br>
Using his ability to Charm initially, Fane got the gnome's ship transferred to himself, as well as the fealty of the crew.  He kept the man around for a period of time, finally turning him into a spawn when he would no longer be missed.
