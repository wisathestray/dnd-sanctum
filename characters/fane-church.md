## Fane Church (Koster)

In life, Fane Koster was a young noble who was born into wealth.  The Koster family was known for their finely tailored clothing, specifically woven to adapt to the wearer.  Fane's father had perfected a technique of weaving transmutation and illusion magics directly into the cloth of garments.  This served to provide exceptional fit and fashion into their products.</br>
Fane was well on his way to taking over the family business when he met an older gentleman who commissioned a suit and cloak.  He found himself flattered by the attention paid to him by the older man (Damon Karthane), and was drawn to his obvious eye for fine clothing.  They spoke at length about clothing, art, and culture - finding they had many shared love and passions.  Upon finding out the true nature of the man known as Damon, Fane found himself even more intrigued.  Another year went by, during which Fane relentlessly dug into the idea of vampires and vampirism.</br>
After many long discussions, and a great deal of reservation on the part of Damon, he finally agreed to turn his younger protoge.  Predictably, Fane's family did not react well to his undeath and he was disowned.  His father, a nobleman of Suloise heritage, called upon the local leaders to destroy both Fane and Damon as a taint upon their lineage.  Fane and Damon fled the region, moving Northwest to X and far from the Koster family name.</br>
Now Fane Church, the new vampire set up a business and began producing garments once again.  Without his father's assistance in procuring cloth, Fane needed to form new business relationships and quickly learned just how difficult that could be as a vampire.  The suppliers most willing to work with a suspected vampire turned out to be some of the least upstanding, and Fane soon found himself working primarily with smugglers.</br>

## Later Life

<b>50 years prior:</b> Damon disappeared
</br>
</br>
<b>30 years prior:</b> Fane met Emilien.  He saw a kindred spirit in his passion for art.  Fane sought out a ship for moving art pieces for Emilien.  Had a shipment intercepted by pirates.  Fane approached a sellsword for more information about the stolen shipment and hired him to recover it.</br>
</br>
Found out that a small coalition of pirates was responsible for the heist.  To avoid future trouble, Fane negotiated a deal with the Admiral (Alston) to provide his ship amnesty (for a fee).  A year or two later, Alston was killed in a shore-side argument over a woman.  His successor, a hot-tempered Gnome with the fantasy version of a Napoleon complex, tried extorting Fane for tenfold the amount he had previously been paying.  After a few months of attempted diplomancy with the man, he severely overstepped Fane's patience by threatening Emilien.</br>
</br>
<b>25 years prior:</b> Using his ability to Charm initially, Fane got the gnome's ship transferred to himself, as well as the loyalty of the crew.  He kept the man around for a period of time, making sure that the Code of the fleet were modified and signed over by Smedley, before finally turning him into a spawn when he would no longer be missed.  Permanently under Fane's control, Smedley served in an advisory role for several more years until he met his end at the hands of several pirates he had wronged in the past.</br>
</br>
<b>20 years prior:</b> The Hold of the Sea Princes had grown large enough that it was not an uncommon name to be mentioned in coastal towns.  Uninterested in the daily operations of the Hold, Fane had the pirates elect the Hold's new Admiral.  Leonore "Lost Soul" Garrick was chosen and held the reins of the armada in a firm fist.  She proved to be a fair leader, and her diplomacy helped her escape several deadly encounters unscathed.</br>
</br>
<b>17 years prior:</b> One of the Hold's ships, in an attempt to intercept and board a merchant ship, instead found themselves heavily outgunned by an unusually well-equipped crew.  They had unwittingly chosen a ship transporting a cargo of magical artifacts, and the two wizards were able to render them dead in the water.  One of the crew members, a member of the Scarlet Brotherhood, saw an opportunity to sew discontent along the coast.  For the next two years, "Sea Princes" ships would begin a series of coastal raids - capturing sailors, sinking ships, and spreading chaos.  Some of the sailors, believed to be destined for slave markets, were able to escape and share their harrowing tale.  All of this was actually by design, intended by the Scarlet Brotherhood to rile up the Crown.</br>
</br>
<b>15 years prior:</b> King Skotti declared war on the Sea Princes, and dealt a heavy blow to their ships.  Leonore was killed in one of the naval skirmishes and Fane found himself once again leaderless.</br>
</br>
<b>13 years prior:</b> Cretin Nightwind is elected Admiral by a thin margin.  He establishes the Cardinal Akubra, as well as the roles of Dukes and Jarls.  He selects Penley Brent and Avalia Tempest to also serve as Cardinals.  He lays out a business plan that stratifies the earnings in the Hold, rewarding the Dukes for bringing on new Jarls.</br>
</br>
<b>10 years prior:</b> Cretin establishes Black Jack Cove and the plantations on the Withering Wastes.  He secures a steady supply of silks for Fane, and negotiates several high profile sales with Eastern nobles.  Unknown to Fane, one of the nobles recognizes the Koster method of weaving.  Stetson Lusilver is employed to assassinate Fane.  He is unsuccessful, and is instead turned into a Vampire Spawn.</br>
</br>
<b>7 years prior:</b> Stetson is exiled to the Withering Wastes (after Fane asked Cretin to "deal with him").  Cretin quietly changed the Code to remove the forbiddance of slavery, and brought the slaves to the Withering Wastes plantations.</br>
</br>
<b>5 years prior:</b> Fowler Swail became a Cardinal.</br>
</br>
<b>2 years prior:</b> Avalia Tempest joined the Hold as a Cardinal, and brought in her Black Seven federation.</br>
