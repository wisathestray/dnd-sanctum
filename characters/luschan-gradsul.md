## Luschan VIII, Duke of Gradsul (Duchess Maria of Gradsul)

Influence:  Elon Musk</br>

A bit of a rich eccentric, Luschan has spent most of his adult life pursuing luxury boatbuilding.  He is a good-natured, hard-working man who is popular with the people of Gradsul.  In addition to his boatbuilding, he is also in the process of prototyping a semi-permanent lighthouse that can be moored in shallow water that is too deep for building a traditional lighthouse.</br>

The Duchess is not involved with her husband's boatbuilding, but she is active in the city of Gradsul with her apothecary.  While not strictly a physician, the Duchess' reputation for curing minor ailments with herbs and tinctures is somewhat of a local legend.  She does not work for the money, but rather for the satisfaction of contributing to the community.
