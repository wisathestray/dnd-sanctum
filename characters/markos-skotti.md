## Markos Skotti

Brother of King Kimbertos Skotti.  Nikias, if he were a human.  Overweight, lazy man with a sense of entitlement and off-putting personality.  He's unpopular and demanding, and his only claim to fame is being the brother of the King.  He's married to a woman named Beverly, although it is a marriage in name only.  Beverly has her own home on the property, and the only reason she sticks around is she enjoys playing the part of a rich noble.
