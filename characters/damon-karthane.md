## Damon Karthane

<b>What he knows of the last 35 years</b></br>
<b>15 years prior:</b> Damon heard repeated mention of the Sea Princes.  He was able to piece together that it was a pirate organization, and that the Brotherhood seemed to have a plan to agitate the Kingdom.  On several occassions, he overheard passing townsfolk speculate as to whether the King would ever act to bring the Sea Princes to heel.</br>
</br>
<b>10 years prior:</b> Damon hears about a dishonored noble who is to be assassinated.  He doesn't have enough information to know that it's Fane, however.</br>
</br>
<b>2 years prior:</b> He hears that "she has been taken care of" which he's able to conclude is a reference to one of the town council members.  He hears reference to both Anders and The Pawn, and is able to conclude they're the same person.  He is able to pick up enough information over the following two years that he can tell one of the Brotherhood agents is close to Anders, and that Anders is being manipulated.</br>
</br>
<b>In the last year:</b> The group has begun talking about an artifact.  It sounds like it's powerful, and the plan is to use it to eliminate particularly high-profile targets.  From the sounds of things, they're trying to contact or invoke a powerful deity.</br>
