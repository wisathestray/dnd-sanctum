## Golden Compass of Venin

<b>Description:</b> This palm-sized compass is actually quite plain, and at a casual glance might be easily dismissed as a purely decorative item.  The cover has a stylized flower worked into it, and a DC 12 Nature check reveals it to be a Sea Rose (sometimes called a Marsh Rose).  When the cover is open, the inside dagger-shaped needle is protected by a glass face.  The inside bears no markings for North, South, East or West - rendering it unsuitable for actual navigation.  However, an inscription on the bottom hints toward the true purpose:
</br></br>
<b><i>"Where lies the nearest trove, be guided thee, be it o'er the land or 'neath the sea"</i></b>
</br></br>
<b>Attunement:</b> To use, one must attune to the compass using a short rest to do so.  During this time of observation, roll a DC 15 Investigation check.  Upon success, the user will come to the following conclusion:
</br></br>
The compass will point toward the nearest small collection of coin.  To prevent it from simply pointing toward a random person who is carrying money nearby, it needs to be set upon a flat surface and surrounded by gold coins.  At that point, the needle will begin to slowly turn on its axis and will complete at least one full revolution before honing in on an exact location.
</br></br>
<b>Mechanically:</b> The compass points toward the nearest collection of treasure that is valued over 1,000 gold.  It does not differentiate between treasure hoards or funds with a place like a bank, so it's somewhat useless near a large city that may have a large vault of collective funds.  If the compass is turned on its side, one could potentially determine the elevation of a treasure (for example, whether it's deep under the sea).
</br></br>
Using triangulation, one could potentially determine how far away a treasure may be located.  On a DC 18 INT check and at least 10 miles of travel, a character can determine how far away a treasure is located.  For each additional 10 miles of travel, the DC is reduced by 1.  Can roll each time the compass has traveled 10 miles or more.
</br></br>
<b>Curse:</b> The compass was gifted to Venin in exchange for his fealty to Abbathor.  For each treasure that he found, he was expected to make a sacrifice of blood or gems to honor the god.  Once a treasure has been uncovered, if a suitable sacrifice is not made to Abbathor by the next sunrise, a full solar eclipse will take place.  The only way to remove the eclipse is to make a suitable offering to Abbathor.  If the eclipe goes on for too many days, the world will begin to see significant impacts such as crop die-back, climate change, animal behavior changes, werebadger activity, and increased cult-like activity.
</br></br>
<b>Miscellaneous:</b> On a DC 15 Religion check (Dwarves may use their History mod if it's better), a character may realize that the dagger is a symbol of Abbathor, a deity of greed.
