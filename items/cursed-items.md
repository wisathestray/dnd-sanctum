## Cursed items

Ideas for cursed items, especially for Baldur's Gate version of Needful Things

### Ring of Magnetic Personality (rare - 5,000 gold)

(Requires Attunement) This intricately wrought silver ring is inlaid with three black diamonds.  When attuned to this ring, the bearer has advantage on Charisma-based checks (but not saving throws) 

Curse:  When attuned to this ring, you draw the attention of EVERYONE, friend or foe alike.  When in combat, enemies must pass a DC 15 CHA save or favor you over all other targets.  Once you have been reduced to 0 HP, the enemy may remove the ring from you as a free action.  This does NOT remove the curse.

### Staggering Scimitar (rare - 5,000 gold)

(Requires Attunement) This magical weapon has a weighted blade, allowing it to be swung harder and do more damage than the average weapon.  (+2 scimitar)

Curse:  Whenever you miss an attack with this weapon, you fall prone.

### Vampiric Blade (rare - 5,000 gold)

(Requires Attunement) This weapon becomes a +1 weapon for 24 hours after having tasted blood (can be activated by the user taking 1 HP damage and using their own blood)  Killing an enemy heals the bearer for 1d4+2.

The wielder can no longer see their reflection in a mirrored surface.

Curse: You have disadvantage on attack rolls made in sunlight.  This includes attacks made indoors, as long as sunlight is visible through windows/ doors/ etc.  This disadvantage also applies if the user is affected by the Daylight spell.  Also applies on overcast days, even with full cloud cover.

### Butcher's Cleaver (rare - 5,000 gold)

(Requires Attunement) This +2 Greataxe or Greatsword provides exceptional reach.  On a fatal blow to an enemy, any overkill damage is applied to the nearest enemy within 10 feet.

Curse: If no enemy is within 10 feet, the overkill damage is done to the nearest ally.  If no other creature is within 10 feet, the user takes the damage instead.
